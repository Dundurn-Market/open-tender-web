# Open Tender

An open source web app powered by the Open Tender e-commerce platform for restaurants.

## Getting started with the Open Tender Web App

This project was originally bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template. See the "Available Scripts" section below for guidance on basic usage.

To get started, pull down a copy of the repo and run `yarn install` in your new directory. This will install all of the dependencies for the project. Once you've done this, follow the steps below to get up and running.

Add an `.env` file that looks like this:

```
SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true
```

Add an `.env.development` file that looks like this:

```
REACT_APP_AUTH_URL=https://api.sandbox.opentender.io
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://api.sandbox.opentender.io/order-api
REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID=[YOUR_OPEN_TENDER_CLIENT_ID]
```

An Open Tender client ID will be provided by the Open Tender dev team.

In `/src/config/brand.js`, add the ID of the brand you're working with (this part of the process will soon change), which will also be provided by the Open Tender dev team.

Once those files have been added, run `yarn start` to start the app. The app should open up at http://localhost:3000, and it should be able to make requests to the Open Tender Sandbox API.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
