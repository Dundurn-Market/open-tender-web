                We pay local farmers and other suppliers fair prices. We pay our
                staff the living wage. We use 100% renewable electricity. We
                deliver on foot, by bicycle or electric powered car. We stock
                our shelves with beautiful things made by people who are your
                neighbours and ours. They donâ€™t have large farms or factories.
                Their products don't arrive on 18 wheel trucks. The item you buy
                from us is their passion.
              </p>
              <p>
                We bake and prepare real food for you here, every day, using
                ingredients we are happy to tell you all about. That is our
                passion.

                Some of our prices may be a little bit higher than theirs. We
                believe that the lower prices that they offer have come at a big
                cost to society. Low employee wages, pressure on farmers to cut
                corners, money taken out of our local economy and a general
                indifference to the community. Even price fixing.
              </p>
              <p>
                An unacceptably large cost in our view.
              </p>
              <p>
                That said, we aim to offer as competitive a price as possible at
                all times. Sometimes our prices will even be better than theirs.
              </p>
              <p>
                Please know that when you buy from us, all of the money stays
                within the community and helps to build a robust local economy.
                We promise never to price fix, mislead, or otherwise treat you
                as simply a consumer. To us, you are a valuable member of our
                community.

                Thanks for shopping!
